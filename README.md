zippermau5 is a wip micromouse robot i'm currently working on

while i prototype on a breadboard and design the pcb, this is where i store the platformio project files

it currently uses:
- floodfill
- teensy 4.1 [cpp]
- dual 1200rpm n20s w/magnetic hall encoder
- drv8833
- 25c 3.7v 850mAh lipo

oh, and if anyone wants them, some bits of old and unused code can be found here: https://github.com/AashvikTyagi/slowmau5
