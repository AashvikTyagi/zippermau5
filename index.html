        <h2>About</h2>
        <i>ZIPPERMAU5</i> is a micromouse robot that I'm currently working on.
        <br><br>
        Here's a small list of this micromouse's features:
        <ul>
            <li>a floodfill mazesolving algorithm, with open/closed maze tactic</li>
            <li>vl53 tOf sensors for maze sensing, with an mpu6050 imu for dead-reckoning</li>
            <li>teensy 4.1, programmed in cpp using the platformio framework</li>
            <li>a custom pcb, designed in easyeda, and manufactured by jlcpcb with assembly for small (lcsc) smd parts</li>
            <li>dual 1200rpm "n20" motors w/magnetic hall encoders</li>
            <li>drv8833 motor driver ic, but I FORGOT TO BREAK OUT THE MOTOR PINS AAAAAGH</li>
            <li>a buzzer, 3 pushbuttons and 3 rgb leds for debugging/interaction</li>
            <li>a 25c 3.7v 850mAh lipo</li>
        </ul>
        I hope I'll take it to a competition some day!

        <h2>Status</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No progress on algorithm for while, going to get back to project soon</li>
            <li>PCB is here, and has been mostly assembled!</li>
            <li>Dumb me forgot to break out the main motor pins... that's the only mistake I've found.</li>
            <li>I do wish that I had made the pcb to let the ToF pins be like <a href="images/better-tof.png">this</a> instead.</li>
            <li>I managed to solder four wires to the tiny TSSOP-16 drv8833, but they broke off... images in gallery, that soldering was impressive!</li>
            <li>Ended up adding an external drv8833 breakout board to the bottom of the board, as soldering big wires to smd is not reliable.</li>
            <li>Used the motors for a competition I didn't have enough time to prepare for, so am going to have to wait around three million days to get replacements... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
        </ul>
